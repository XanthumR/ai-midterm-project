# 🗺️ Dijkstra Map Path Finder

This project is an interactive web application that allows users to select two points on a map and visualize the shortest path between them using **Dijkstra's algorithm**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌍 Interactive map powered by [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/)
- 📍 Click to select start and end points
- 📊 Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path
- 🧠 Modular and clean algorithm implementation
- 📦 Easy to install and run locally

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6)
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) for map rendering
- HTML/CSS
- Node JS for live server

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XanthumR/ai-midterm-project.git
   ```
2. Start the live server
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
Done you can select anywhere in muğla and it draws the shortest path.
